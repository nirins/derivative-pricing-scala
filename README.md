I learnt how to price derivatives from books, online courses, and some websites. Mostly it was about models like Binomial and formulas like Black-Scholes. With few examples, I felt like I kind of understood about them, but was not so sure. So I, as a programmer, thought it would be fun to implement what I learnt into source code. And so I created this project.


## Pricing European Option
    1. Binomial Model
        /src/Option/Binomial

    2. Monte Carlo
        /src/Option/MonteCarlo

    3. Black-Scholes
        /src/Option/BlackScholes

		
## Pricing Swap
    1. Vanilla Swap 
        /src/Swap
